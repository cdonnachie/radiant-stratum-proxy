# Share difficulty divisor (controls how often miners submit shares)
# Formula: share_difficulty = network_difficulty / SHARE_DIFFICULTY_DIVISOR
# HIGHER value = EASIER shares = MORE frequent submissions
# LOWER value = HARDER shares = LESS frequent submissions
# 1.0 = network difficulty (only blocks submitted, no intermediate shares)
# 1000.0 = default balanced setting (recommended for production)
# 10000.0 = very easy shares, frequent submissions (good for testing/stats)
SHARE_DIFFICULTY_DIVISOR=1000.0

# === Variable Difficulty (VarDiff) Settings ===
# Optional per-miner adaptive difficulty targeting a share interval.
# Enable this to have the proxy automatically adjust each miner's difficulty so
# they (on average) submit one accepted share every target interval.
# When ENABLE_VARDIFF=true the static SHARE_DIFFICULTY_DIVISOR is ignored for
# connected miners (still used as a fallback if VarDiff fails).
# Recommended starting point: enable once you have multiple heterogeneous miners.

# Master switch (false = use fixed divisor only)
ENABLE_VARDIFF=false

# Target time between accepted shares per miner (seconds)
VARDIFF_TARGET_SHARE_TIME=15.0

# Bounds for per-miner difficulty (network uses very low absolute difficulty values)
# Observed KCN/LCN shareDiff / chain diff range: ~0.000001 – 0.01
# Start tiny so slow CPUs still produce an initial share quickly.
# Raise MAX only if high-hashrate miners are hitting the target interval too fast even
# at the upper bound (watch /api/vardiff_state for saturation).
VARDIFF_MIN_DIFFICULTY=0.00001        # Lowest allowed difficulty (previous example 0.01)
VARDIFF_MAX_DIFFICULTY=0.1            # Upper bound; plenty for 10–50x faster nodes
# Difficulty sizing math:  expected_time_seconds ≈ difficulty * 2^32 / hashrate_Hs
# Rearranged: difficulty ≈ hashrate_Hs * target_time / 2^32.
# With target=15s and 2^32 ≈ 4.294e9:
# difficulty ≈ hashrate_Hs * 3.493e-9.
#
# Accurate rough guide (target 15s):
#   25  KH/s  -> diff ≈ 0.000087
#   50  KH/s  -> diff ≈ 0.000175
#  100  KH/s  -> diff ≈ 0.000349
#  250  KH/s  -> diff ≈ 0.000873
#  500  KH/s  -> diff ≈ 0.001746
# 1000  KH/s  -> diff ≈ 0.00349  ( = 1 MH/s )
#
# Your observed shareDiff values (e.g. 0.000004 – 0.000015) are well below these
# targets, which is why shares arrive more frequently than 15s initially; VarDiff will
# ramp the difficulty upward toward the band implied above.
