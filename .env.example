# Share difficulty divisor (controls how often miners submit shares)
# Formula: share_difficulty = network_difficulty / SHARE_DIFFICULTY_DIVISOR
# HIGHER value = EASIER shares = MORE frequent submissions
# LOWER value = HARDER shares = LESS frequent submissions
# 1.0 = network difficulty (only blocks submitted, no intermediate shares)
# 1000.0 = default balanced setting (recommended for production)
# 10000.0 = very easy shares, frequent submissions (good for testing/stats)

# === Variable Difficulty (VarDiff) Settings ===
# Optional per-miner adaptive difficulty targeting a share interval.
# Enable this to have the proxy automatically adjust each miner's difficulty so
# they (on average) submit one accepted share every target interval.
# When ENABLE_VARDIFF=true the static SHARE_DIFFICULTY_DIVISOR is ignored for
# connected miners (still used as a fallback if VarDiff fails).
# Recommended starting point: enable once you have multiple heterogeneous miners.

# Difficulty sizing math:  expected_time_seconds ≈ difficulty * 2^32 / hashrate_Hs
# Rearranged: difficulty ≈ hashrate_Hs * target_time / 2^32.
# With target=15s and 2^32 ≈ 4.294e9:
# difficulty ≈ hashrate_Hs * 3.493e-9.
#
# Rough guide (target 15s):
#   25  KH/s  -> diff ≈ 0.000087
#   50  KH/s  -> diff ≈ 0.000175
#  100  KH/s  -> diff ≈ 0.000349
#  250  KH/s  -> diff ≈ 0.000873
